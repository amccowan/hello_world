# hello_world
I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm trying


i take it in but don't look down..
'cause I'm on top of the world, eH!
I'm on top of the world, eh!

been waitin like this for a while now
paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, eh!
been holdin it in for a while, eh!

take me with you if I can
been dreamin of this since a child

'cause I'm on top of the world
